# NYC Bike-Sharing Analysis and Dashboard
## Analysis into bike sharing

### Overview

This project is designed to address the logistical challenges faced by Citi Bike, New York City’s premier bike-sharing service. By analyzing user behavior and identifying patterns, the project aims to optimize bike distribution across the city and uncover opportunities for system expansion. With a focus on providing actionable insights, the project leverages open data and advanced visualization tools to create an interactive and insightful dashboard.

The goal is to support the business strategy team by delivering data-driven recommendations to improve bike availability, mitigate customer dissatisfaction, and strengthen Citi Bike's position as a leader in eco-friendly urban transportation.

Through the use of open-source data and various Python libraries, this project culminates in an interactive dashboard designed to effectively communicate the findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
